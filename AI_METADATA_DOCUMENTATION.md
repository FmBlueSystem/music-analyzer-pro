## ⚙️ Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
```javascript
// Example validation function
function validateAIMetadata(metadata) {
  const validations = {
    AI_ACOUSTICNESS: (val) => val >= 0.0 && val <= 1.0,
    AI_BPM: (val) => val >= 60.0 && val <= 200.0,
    AI_CONFIDENCE: (val) => val >= 0.0 && val <= 1.0,
    AI_TIME_SIGNATURE: (val) => [3,4,5,6,7].includes(val),
    AI_MODE: (val) => ['Major', 'Minor'].includes(val)
  };
  
  // Validate each field...
}
```

### For Music Analysts
1. **Always preserve Mixed In Key data** - Never override professional analysis
2. **Use AI_BPM separately** - Complement, don't replace professional BPM
3. **Consider genre context** - Some fields may not apply to all genres
4. **Validate confidence levels** - Lower confidence indicates uncertain analysis

### For Audio Engineers
1. **Audio quality matters** - Higher quality input = higher confidence analysis
2. **Consider mastering effects** - Heavy compression affects analysis accuracy
3. **Monitor dynamic range** - Impacts energy and loudness calculations
4. **Check for artifacts** - Digital artifacts can skew analysis results
